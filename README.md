This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in assembly code: out-of-bounds memory access. The bug.asm file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element using an index that may exceed the array's bounds. This can lead to program crashes or unpredictable behavior. The bugSolution.asm file provides a corrected version of the code, adding bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds access and improve the overall robustness of the program.  This example showcases the importance of careful memory management in assembly programming.
